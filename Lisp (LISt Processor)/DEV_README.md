### Deletion

The lisplogo.png file has 2 instances, a separate instance in its own directory was made on June 19th 2020 to replace the original instance, but I have noted that a root copy may be necessary due to compatibility issues.

***

### Samples

The samples folder contains a collection of sample LISP programs and scripts. The scripts for this directory have been verified to work.

***

### Documentation

I included a copy of the Wikipedia article where I got my research from. Other research can go here, but it has to go in its own dated folder, and the resources have to have the version date in the title. If the version date is not found, just label its version as the latest version that you have.
